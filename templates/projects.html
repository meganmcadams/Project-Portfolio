                        <p>Written in C++, this program automated the tuition validation process for over 42,000 
                            students and over half a billion dollars at the University of North Texas for the 
                            Student Accounting office. <br><br>It reads in student data, and using settings files, 
                            it determines how much each student should be receiving for a charge, if any. One 
                            settings file lists the restrictions for each charge using pseudocode to determine 
                            the conditions to receive it, and a second settings file lists the restrictions for 
                            each amount and how much per credit hour the amount costs as well as its cap. The 
                            original version was written in C++, but all of the settings were hardcoded. It was 
                            later rewritten in Python using dictionaries to store the data using external settings 
                            files, so no code needs to be changed when updating the settings.

                            added pages. When a user creates a page, they can link other pages and use basic HTML functions such as 
                            bolding and italicising using special pre-defined symbols. These symbols are parsed through after the user
                            publishes the page, and they are translated to HTML. This is to prevent the user from using pure HTML and 
                            being able to inject harmful HTML into the website. <br></p>

                        <h4>Payment Plan Estimator</h4><small>Python</small>
                        <p>I wrote a program in Python to estimate the division of a student's total tuition &amp; fees for the semester across three installments with three different payment plan options: Short Term Loan, Installment Plan, and Installment Plan STB (with no down payment). This program has a functioning GUI to make it easier for the employees at Student Accounting to use. The GUI was built using PySimpleGUI.&nbsp;<br><br>It reads in the student's total due charges and their anticipated aid (financial aid that has yet to disperse), reads in which payment plan the user would like to make an estimate for, subtracts the down payment (if any), and divides the remaining charges across the three payment deadlines. The anticipated aid is subtracted starting with the first installment and rolls over to other installments, as it doesn't evenly divide amongst the installments.&nbsp;<br><br>Previous to this program, there was not an accurate way to estimate how installments would be broken up with anticipated aid for the Student Accounting office at UNT. Despite the simplicity of the program, it was used very often for students until we switched to a different payment plan method.</p>

                        <p>
                            To learn Java, I created a program that reads from a text file a list of 
                            reptiles and their features, and stores them in a dictionary using a balanced 
                            binary search tree implementation. When the user searches for a reptile, it 
                            performs a search using the binary search tree to return the result in O(log n) 
                            time. In addition to the search feature, the user can delete a node from the
                            tree, which will cause the tree to rebalance to maintain its O(log n) time
                            complexity.

                        <p>For my clubs' communication channels, I coded a bot to handle the 
                            verification of users. It is a UNT policy that official communication channels 
                            must have each member's name set to their first and last name, so I set up the 
                            group so that you must be verified to send messages.<br><br>The bot works by 
                            waiting for the user to verify that they have read the rules before comparing the 
                            user's nickname (or username if no nickname is set) to a regular expression that 
                            checks if the user's nickname is a first name followed by a last initial. If it does not 
                            match, it messages the user explaining that they did not update their nickname 
                            accordingly and returns. If it does match, verifies the user and
                            messages them with a success message.<br></p>
