                <p>Using Python Flask for the framework, the Wikipedia clone project allows users to create an account and
                    log in, create and edit pages, and navigate pages through the navbar, which autopopulates with newly
                    added pages. When a user creates a page, they can link other pages and use basic HTML functions such as 
                    bolding and italicising using special pre-defined symbols. These symbols are parsed through after the user
                    publishes the page, and they are translated to HTML. This is to prevent the user from using pure HTML and 
                    being able to inject harmful HTML into the website. <br></p>

                    The balanced binary search tree dictionary reads from a text file a list of 
                    reptiles and their features, and stores them in a dictionary using a balanced 
                    binary search tree implementation. When the user searches for a reptile, it 
                    performs a search using the binary search tree to return the result in O(log n) 
                    time. In addition to the search feature, the user can delete a node from the
                    tree, which will cause the tree to rebalance to maintain its O(log n) time
                    complexity.

                <h4>Tuition Validation</h4><small>Python/C++</small>
                <p>Written in C++ and later rewritten in Python, this program automated the tuition 
                    validation process for over 42,000 
                    students and over half a billion dollars at the University of North Texas for the 
                    Student Accounting office. <br><br>It reads in student data, and using settings files, 
                    it determines how much each student should be receiving for a charge, if any. One 
                    settings file lists the restrictions for each charge using pseudocode to determine 
                    the conditions to receive it, and a second settings file lists the restrictions for 
                    each amount and how much per credit hour the amount costs as well as its cap. The 
                    original version was written in C++, but all of the settings were hardcoded. It was 
                    rewritten in Python to clean up the code and practice the language.

                <h4>Payment Plan Estimator</h4><small>Python</small>
                <p>I wrote a program in Python to estimate the division of a student's total tuition &amp; fees for the 
                    semester across three installments with three different payment plan options: Short Term Loan, 
                    Installment Plan, and Installment Plan STB (with no down payment). This program has a functioning 
                    GUI to make it easier for the employees at Student Accounting to use. The GUI was built using 
                    PySimpleGUI.
                    &nbsp;<br><br>
                    It reads in the student's total due charges and their anticipated aid 
                    (financial aid that has yet to disperse), reads in which payment plan the user would like to 
                    make an estimate for, subtracts the down payment (if any), and divides the remaining charges 
                    across the three payment deadlines. The anticipated aid is subtracted starting with the first 
                    installment and rolls over to other installments, as it doesn't evenly divide amongst the 
                    installments.
                    &nbsp;<br><br>
                    Previous to this program, there was not an accurate way to estimate 
                    how installments would be broken up with anticipated aid for the Student Accounting office at 
                    UNT. Despite the simplicity of the program, it was used very often for students until we switched 
                    to a different payment plan method.</p>

                <p>For my clubs' communication channels, I coded a bot to handle the 
                    verification of users. The bot uses a regular expression to validate that the user's
                    username is appropriate and contains their first and last name. If it matches, the bot
                    verifies the user. Otherwise, it messages the user stating why their username did not
                    match the expected format.
